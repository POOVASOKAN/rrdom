created a web page with routes using react-router-dom.
Design Reference: The design of the page should be based on the following URL: https://www.guvi.in/blog/
1) Designed HTML, CSS for the page and imported them in React files
2) Created arrays based on the Nav items and linked using link tag in Navbar
3) Created components and rendered the cards based on the Map method in the corresponding cards
4) By default it displays the Home page using the Route path

Enjoyed Creating !!!!
